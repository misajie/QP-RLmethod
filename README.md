# QP-RLmethod
Author: Misajie
Update: 20220731
## Description
This repository aims to conduct a research project on applying RL methods to speed up active set method.

## Main contributions
+ a active set solver that can interactively change the working set
+ two different environment to apply RL in active set methods
+ several deterministic agents trying to learn policy to choose constraints in the working set
